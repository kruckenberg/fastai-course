## Self-Check: Hand-Tuning a Simple Model

1. We generated some "noisy" data points. Describe the process we used to
   discover or "learn" a quadratic function that fit the data. Provide as much
   detail as you can.
2. In particular, how did we use the mean absolute error loss function to
   evaluate the "fitness" of candidate functions?
3. Why would hand-tuning a modern deep learning model be impractical?
