# Self-Check: Image Classification Without Machine Learning

1. What is in the MNIST dataset? How is the data structured?
2. Explain how a gray-scale image is represented?
3. Describe the basic strategy we used to classify images.
4. We used two different methods to measure the similarity between a test image
   and the "averaged" images.
   1. What are the two methods?
   2. How are they similar? How different?
   3. Which (if either) is better? Why?
5. How well does our similarity classifier work?
6. What are the limitations of our approach?
7. More technical: what is the difference between a scalar, a vector, and a
   matrix? How can each be represented by a tensor?
